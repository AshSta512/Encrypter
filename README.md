# Encrypter

## Description

Encrypter is a standalone Java program made using the Swing API. 

The main functions of Encrypter are related to encrypting and decrypting text using a password.

Encrypter is primarily useful for sending secret messages to others or saving text that requires a password to retrieve.

## Using the Program

> Enter text to encrypt/decrypt.

> (Optional) Enter password.

> Text is encrypted/decrypted using the Java Cipher class with the given password alongside an algorithm, mode, and padding. (Note: these parameters are customizable through enabling "Advanced Mode" in Encrypter.)

> The inputted text, password, and encrypted/decrypted text is outputted in the history panel. (Note: outputted encrypted text is converted to Base64 for easier saving but it is still encrypted.)
